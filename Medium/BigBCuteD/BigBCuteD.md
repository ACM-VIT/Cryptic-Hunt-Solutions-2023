The above passage should translate as follows with reference to amitabh bachchan and abhishek bachchan and eventually Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. This is with reference to the movie ROBOT(chitti wali). The scene starts with aishwarya(sana) coming out of TT(weird structure) and then going back in. The next clue must be placed on one of the notice boards/near the watchman desk/TBI manager office.
