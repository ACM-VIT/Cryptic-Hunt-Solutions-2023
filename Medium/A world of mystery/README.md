## Description

Concept: When multiple things are linked together it gets to figure out what is the right way to get
the answer. A World of Mystery, thus ensues.

## Solution

1. The HTML file 'home.html' is to be opened and an animated image of computer can be seen. Clicking  the image takes you to another web page 'text-page.html'
2. In 'text-page.html' a welcome sign can be seen and on scrolling down you can see a text that says, "Do you have what it takes?'
3. Just above the text is another hidden text which can be viewed upon highlighting it. the text says, "What and Enigma it is"
4. On inspecting elements of the 'text-page.html' you can find a comment that has a coded text, "hajgf mwxak exjha jxfzc zdnwd k"
5. On decoding the text using the Enigma machine you will get: go back steg r7 most significant
6. Now we need to go back to 'home.html'
7. the image in this page needs to be downloaded using the 'save as' feature of the browser.
8. this image contains a key encoded using MSB steganography with the red bits encoded int the 8th row (7 index). the key is: **543wertuiokkk@#**
9. On inspecting the elements of 'home.html' you will find a drive link.
10. This drive link goes to an encrypted file whose key was encoded into the image. https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Xg5q0s4dOLcWpnDYK5stkYGwa362BxN/view?usp=drive_link
11. the encrypted file contains the flag: **fincrypt**
