## Solution

1. Step 1 specifics
a text will be provided to the user 

Wnpbofguny naq Zrefraar, jrer hfryrff va gur uvfgbevpny fcnpr jvgu ab zrnavat be inyhr va na beqre be fbpvrgl

the given text can be decoded using the rot 13 algorithm it will decode to the following

Jacobsthal and Mersenne, were useless in the historical space with no meaning or value in an order or society .


2. Step 2 specifics

a number sequences list corresponding to the jacobsthal and mersenne prime number list will be provided after striking
out the numbers corresponding to the sequences a few numbers will be remaining which joined together will give the coordinates
for SJT
