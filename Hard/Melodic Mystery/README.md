## Description

Enter a symphonic puzzle realm, where the language of notes holds the key. In this musical enigma, decode the melodies on the sheets to reveal the hidden answer, and let the tunes guide your quest to triumph.

## Solution

1. The pdf contains some staff notation. The players will have to use the 'Music Sheet Cipher' to decode the notes.
2. After decryption they get this : "Vivaldi's Seasons hold the pwd.Each composition has a unique scale,which is the melodic clue you seek."
3. The players will then have to find out which scale each compostion from Vivaldi's Four Seasons is in and place the scales in the order of the original arrangement ( Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter )
4. The scales when put together give the password to the zip file.
5. Each arrangement has three parts, all in different scales. (So the pasword will have 12 characters in total)
6. Spring : EcE
   Summer : ggg
   Autumn : FdF
   Winter : fEf
   Password : EcEgggFdFfEf
7. If the scale is a major scale then the letter should be upper-case and if it is in a minor scale then the letter should be lower-case. 
8. The players only have to use the letter of the scale and ignore flats and sharps ( For eg - if the scale is A sharp minor/major, then they only have to take a/A).
9. Using this password the players will have to open the password-protected zip file.
10. The zip file contains an image of iron man.
11. The players will then have to go to the area behind anna audi where there is a graffiti of iron man.
12. There they will find a qr code. On scanning the qr code they will get another riddle.
13. Where melodies bloom and talents shine,
    In the heart of VIT, this place aligns.
    Seek the muse where music club intertwines.
