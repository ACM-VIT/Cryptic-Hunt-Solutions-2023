## Solution

The challenge begins with a poem that leads you to the location of a QR code:

\```
A lovely shelter
Suddenly Dahmer shows
Ah, run for your life!
\```

The poem guides you to a place where you'll find the QR code(The poem is haiku that leads to H.O.M.E - **Human Organ Manufacturing Building behind Anna Auditorium**). Scanning this code will take you to a pastebin link containing a Java code snippet and hints. One of these hints will guide you to a VirusTotal hash file, and another will be about deciphering the name of the Java file using a Rail Fence Cipher.

### Steps:

1. Decode the poem to find the location of the QR code.
2. Scan the QR code to access the pastebin containing the Java code snippet and hints.
3. Click the link to the VirusTotal hash file for additional secrets.
4. Use the Rail Fence Cipher hint from the pastebin to decrypt the Java file's name.
5. Combine all the clues to find the final solution.

**Solution**: [TBD, specify the final solution in the format you prefer]
