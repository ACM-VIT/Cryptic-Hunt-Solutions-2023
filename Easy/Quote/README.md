## Description

“Are you a literature connoisseur? Get ready to face your ULTIMATE test! Fill in the unfinished quote using the hints given below and prove your prowess"

## Solution

A code in the script of JRR Tolkein's universe will be given along with a Tolkein quote. This when converted into latin script will be a simple substitution cypher.
The deciphered rune will be a quote from The one of the books from the Wizarding World Of Harry potter along with a few numbers

**The Tolkein Quote:** "I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil"

Deciphering the runes will reveal two strings:

> “You dare use my own spells against me, Potter?"
> "Title: 15 16 17 2 13 15 16 3 7 6 24 31 32 30 17 11 10 _ 29 32 _ 10 14 "

The numbers will reveal a name of another book "The Anthropocene Reviewed" By John Green

Then The Third clue will give this incomplete quote which can be completed by knowing the name of the book from clue 2

> “The.....fixable.”
>
> “The past is neither fixed nor fixable.”

This quote string will be the solution to the puzzle
