## Solution

1. The rebus puzzle suggests that player must look for size of the "BASE". when the player opens the link and inspects the elements, he finds a link to a docX file. Player needs to determine the size of the "BASE" which is 64. This gives out the cipher, i.e base-64.
2. When player goes through inspect elements, he also finds a second hyperlink (which is hidden) in same webpage, it leads to another webpage.
3. The second webpage is seemingly blank but contains a string "VGhlIEx1bmdzIE9mIFRoZSBFYXJ0aA==".
4. The string is to be inserted in a base64 decoder (UTF-8 charset) which provides the location of the QR code. The string reads "The Lungs Of the earth" which suggests the Amazon kiosk near library.
5. Scan the QR code.
