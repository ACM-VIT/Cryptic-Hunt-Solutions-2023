## Description

“Unravel the secrets of forbidden knowledge hidden in the deepest depths. Crack the unbreakable codes and save the world from the clutches of the evil  puppet-master lurking in the shadows with the help of an unknown HERO. Who is this person? Can they help you solve the mystery code?” 

## Solution

A photo of a famous personality(Alan Turing) is provided along with an encrypted phrase ("gktwx gegzq") . This code can be decrypted using the photo of the famous personality given

1. Identify The Famous Personality(Alan Turing)
2. Find out his major achievement (cracking the Enigma Machine)
3. Solve the code using an enigma decryptor (Reveals the answer string : "hello world")
