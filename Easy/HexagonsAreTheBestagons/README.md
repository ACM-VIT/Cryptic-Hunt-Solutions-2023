## Description

Riddle 1:
    In angles six, I stand so tall,
    A shape unique, in architecture's thrall.
    With sides and corners, symmetrical and bright,
    What am I, a masterpiece of design and light?
Riddle 2:
    In Vellore's embrace, my wisdom blooms,
    Tamil's heritage, I lovingly groom.
    Author and scholar, with knowledge to share,
    Who am I, nurturing Tamil's care?
