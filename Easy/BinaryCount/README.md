2. They have to convert the binary to text.There are binary to text convertor available on the internet.
3. The text is an acrostic poem.The first letter of each new line spells out a message "WHATISTHCOUNTOFONES". That is "What is th count of ones".
4. The player will then count the number of ones in the binary. They can just write a code to count '1' in a string to get the count of ones in the binary.

Poem after converting binary to string.

Within the realm of cryptography's art,\
Hidden messages and codes take their part.\
Algorithms dance, ciphers secure,\
Transforming plaintext to keep thoughts pure.

Intricate locks with keys held tight,\
Safeguarding data day and night.\
Techniques evolve as breaches increase,\
Holding the line, ensuring the peace.

Caught in the dance of bits that run,\
Only the skilled can make the code undone.\
Unveiling mysteries, minds align,\
Numbers and symbols intertwine.

To decipher the secrets, minds race,\
Overcoming challenges, they embrace.\
Forge ahead with intellect's sun,\
Onward they journey, till all is won.

Navigating labyrinths of ones and zeros,\
Experts and novices, all become heroes,\
Stepping through gateways, where brilliance shone.
